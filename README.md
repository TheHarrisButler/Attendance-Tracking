# attendance_tracker

It is the daily pre-class ritual of many professors here at UT Tyler, and I am sure around the country. The printed paper sign-in sheet. The teacher gives the paper to the first person in the front row as asks them to pass the sheet around and have every person sign their name. This, for many reasons, is a flawed system. First, in a world that is getting more and more automated, why doesn't this trend start to move its way into the classroom. This is a process that is not only inefficient and slow but takes away from time dedicated to the class. Second, it is terrible at its job. The point is to have a record that every student registered for the class comes to class. Unfortunately, this does not always happen. Many times the sheet misses people. What about the people that show up late? Although students should be in class on time, the sign-in paper cannot register people that show up late. Third, when tracking attendance over a semester or more, the sign-in paper is pretty much worthless. The professor takes that sheet, transfers the information to a spreadsheet, tracks who is and isn't coming to class. When there are 30 people in a class, this can become monotonous quickly. Even still, how helpful is that information to a professor or the school? There is no statistical trends or any user data that is produced by the sheet. Finally, the clickers. Although this is a much better system than the sign-in sheet, it still has its issues. First of all, it requires each student to go out and buy some T.V remote looking device or download an app where you still have to pay a fee to use. While this is much more efficient at registering students than the sign-in sheet, it still isn't fully automated and requires the student to press a button or log in to an application. There are also holes in the clicker systems registering process. Because the clickers are essentially T.V. remotes all they need is to be within the limits of the radio signal to register. Often this signal reaches outside of the class room, which allows for registration without being in the classroom. If using a phone application, then all the student needs is a connection to the school WIFI, and the student will be able to register.

My teamâ€™s solution to this problem is a fully automated attendance tracking software. This software will automatically register a student without any user interaction. Using an application downloaded onto a smartphone the software will use QR codes to log the student when he or she sits at the desk. At the micro-level teacher's will be able to see which students did or did not attend class. At the macro level, administrators, deans, and headmasters will be able to see the attendance statistics of the entire school.
